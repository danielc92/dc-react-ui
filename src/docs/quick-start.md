### Installing node

Robust React UI is being developed using [the latest LTS Node release](https://nodejs.org/en/) (the current LTS is `14.17.1`). It is recommended to use this version with the library, albeit other versions may work perfectly fine too.

### Installing with npm

```shell
npm install robust-react-ui
```

### Installing with yarn

```shell
yarn add robust-react-ui
```
