### Installing node

Robust React UI is being developed using [the latest LTS Node release](https://nodejs.org/en/) (the current LTS is `14.17.1`). It is recommended to use this version with the library, albeit other versions may work perfectly fine too.

### Installing with npm

```shell
npm install robust-react-ui
```

### Installing with yarn

```shell
yarn add robust-react-ui
```

### Importing the styles

Robust React UI comes with both compressed (minified) and uncompressed css. You will need to import either of these CSS files into the root of your react application.

```shell
import 'robust-react-ui/build/styles/main.css'
```

or minified:

```shell
import 'robust-react-ui/build/styles/main.min.css'
```
