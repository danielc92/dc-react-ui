Robust React UI is built with the following points in mind.

### Robust components

- Full typescript support to increase developer productivity.
- Components are heavily tested, such that unexpected bugs are minimised.
- Most components use the controlled component design pattern, meaning you can separate your component data into the parent component, making managing state easier.

### Strong focus on accessibility

- Most of the components functionality is ported over from aria 1.1 spec.
- Designs are also tested using the a11y storybook addon.

### Theme support & modern CSS

- General theming support for component sizes and colours via props.
- This project makes use of CSS variables, meaning overriding CSS is simple, and creating custom themes (such as a dark theme) is achievable in a short amount of time.
